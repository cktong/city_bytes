<h1>City Bytes</h1>
	<p>What does sprawl look like? How does downtown Los Angeles compare to Manhattan? Inspired by the 2010 TED talk by <a href= 'https://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations#t-23489'> Geoffrey West</a> on the mathematical laws governing cities, this ongoing project aims to provide a tool for researchers to simplify and understand the underlying properties that govern cities, towns and regions throughout the United States. Use this site to explore the amount of businesses, eateries and grocery stores within 500 meters of an intersection.</p>
